# UnoGenerator

## Description
Python module to generate Libreoffice documents (ODT and ODS) programatically.

Morever, you can export them to (.xlsx, .docx, .pdf) easyly.

It uses Libreoffice uno module, so you need Libreoffice to be installed in your system.

## Installation
You can use pip to install this python package:

`pip install unogenerator`

## ODT 'Hello World' example

This is a Hello World example. You get the example in odt, docx and pdf formats:

First you have to launch libreoffice as a service. Run `unogenerator_start`.

```python
from unogenerator import ODT_Standard
doc=ODT_Standard()
doc.addParagraph("Hello World", "Heading 1")
doc.addParagraph("Easy, isn't it","Standard")
doc.save("hello_world.odt")
doc.export_docx("hello_world.docx")
doc.export_pdf("hello_world.pdf")
doc.close()
```

## ODS 'Hello World' example

This is a Hello World example. You'll get example files in ods, xlsx and pdf formats:

You don't have to relaunch `unogenerator_start` if you did before

```python
from unogenerator import ODS_Standard
doc=ODS_Standard()
doc.addCellMergedWithStyle("A1:E1", "Hello world", style="BoldCenter")
doc.save("hello_world.ods")
doc.export_xlsx("hello_world.xlsx")
doc.export_pdf("hello_world.pdf")
doc.close()
```
